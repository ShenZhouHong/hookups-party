        Webapp is organized into slides. Each slide is a discrete container that
        holds everything for that slide. Containers are usually set to the max
        height of the viewpoint (e.g. height: 100vh).

        The first slide is visible as it is the landing page, however subsequent
        slides are collapsed. They are shown interactively
        through javascript
