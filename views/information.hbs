        Webapp is organized into slides. Each slide is a discrete container that
        holds everything for that slide. Containers are usually set to the max
        height of the viewpoint (e.g. height: 100vh).

        The first slide is visible as it is the landing page, however subsequent
        slides are collapsed. They are shown interactively
        through javascript

                <h3>Why are you doing this?</h3>
                <p>
                    Love is free, and should be celebrated. It can be expressed
                    in many different forms. And although hooking up is not for
                    everyone, it deserves to be acknowledged as a form of
                    intimacy. As much as this site is created for faciliating
                    hookups, it is also an experiment designed for us to
                    reevaluate our percpetions of sexuality and physical
                    intimacy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sexuality is one of the most fundemental aspects of the
                    human experience, and much of our society has been built
                    around our expressions of sexual attraction. Beginning from
                    the highly ritualized courtships of Medieval romances, to
                    modern dating culture - the ways we acknowledge and interact
                    with sexual relationships is changing. Is this the next
                    step? Who knows?
                </p>
                <h3>Is this for real?</h3>
                <p>
                    Yes, it is! Simply select your gender, the gender of your
                    preferred partner, and your sexual preferences. You will be
                    automatically and anonymously matched with a suitable
                    person. Give it a try!
                </p>

                <p>
                    It's okay. This may seem like a unbelievable thing at first,
                    but trust us - it works!

                Privacy is our most important concern, and we take active measures
                to secure your data. Usage of HookupsðŸ’‹ is free, and does not
                require login or authentication, so no information about your
                real identity is ever collected. Furthermore, all of the
                messages are never stored on the server, but rather they are
                immediately sent to the clients. Therefore, no record of your
                conversations would ever touch our hard disks.
