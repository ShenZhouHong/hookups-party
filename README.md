# Hookups💋 @ CSC
A simple hookup app designed for anonymous romantic liaisons.

Built using express, socket.io, and the latest HTML5 technologies. Responsive and
mobile-first.

## TODO list
- [X] Write documentation for changes
- [X] Get Giuseppe to look at the weird socket bugs in chat. Might be caused by some weird minify edge case?
- [X] Implement 'bubble-styled' chat UI and replace placeholder well
- [X] Further modularize CSS for chat
- [X] Working session management to prevent multiple users on the same client
- [X] Add match GUI to notify user when a match is found
- [X] Audio framework for "pop" sounds when messages arrive
- [ ] **Secure websocket implementation and strictly check inputs!!!**
- [ ] Implement progressive font rendering to prevent FOIC
- [ ] Add a comprehensive unit testing framework for javascript code
- [ ] On mobile devices, when the phone sleeps the websocket disconnects. Upon wakeup, when client tries to send a message the **node server crashes**
- [ ] Session checking is still extremely weird. Sometimes, on mobile the session is seen as duplicated, even when it's not.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
In order to begin installing and developing the newest version of **Hookups💋**,
a proper NodeJS environment is needed. Make sure to have `node` and `npm`
installed and available on your system.

* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/)
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

### Installing dependencies via npm
Next, download all of the dependencies related to this project with npm.

```
npm install
```

To build the minified javascript and CSS files required for running the site,
additional devDependencies such as `grunt` are also required.

```
npm install --devDependencies
```

### Building javascript and CSS files with grunt
Hookups💋 now uses `grunt` as an automated toolchain for combining, stripping,
and minifying source javascript and HTML files. These files have to be built in
order to run Hookups💋. In addition, `grunt` also assists development by automatically linting the javascript files using `jshint`.

##### Build targets

As of commit `47446ee`, the `grunt` build system has been refactored and
modularized to have different build options for different environments. Hookups💋
is configured to build according to two different buld targets:

 - `development`: Javascript is linted for quality control. Furthermore Javascript and CSS are combined and minified with sourcemaps, for the ease of debugging.
 - `production`: Javascript and CSS are further optimized and minified without sourcemaps, for smaller filesizes.

When running Hookups💋build `grunt` to the desired target environment. If you
plan to develop Hookups💋, the `development` target will aid debugging and provide linting while
the production target is optimized for a production environment:

```
grunt production
```
or

```
grunt development
```

Of course, for switching between `production` and `development` toolchains, simply
rerun the commands desired, and the files will be overwritten.

**Please note:** compiled and minified javascript and CSS files are **NOT**
including as a part of the project repository! Therefore, in order to run the
project, these files must be built with `grunt`!

When that is done, start the node server by simply running:

```
npm start
```

#### Build Pipeline Overview
When running `grunt development`:

```
Development build pipeline:
Step:   [Sources]   [Linting]   [Minify]    [Linting]   [Final]
Files:  ├──.js  ---→ jshint ---→ uglify ---→ jshint ---→ ├──.min.js
        └──.css ---------------→ cssmin ---------------→ └──.min.css
```

When running `grunt production`:

```
Production build pipeline:
Step:   [Sources]              [Minify]                 [Final]
Files:  ├──.js  --------------→ uglify ----------------→ ├──.min.js
        └──.css --------------→ cssmin ----------------→ └──.min.css
```

At this point, if there are no errors, the installation process is complete.
You may now start developing or using Hookups💋 @ CSC!

## Project structure documentation
As of the commit `fd3ab`, Hookups💋 has been refactored to use `grunt` as a
toolchain component. This means the directory structure has changed. Previously,
`.css` and `.js` files are not minified, and are stored under `public/`. These
files were edited directly.

Now, all source files are stored under `resources/sources`, and are not publicly
accessible. These are read by `grunt`, combined with other relevant files, and
then minified:

### Simplified example diagram
All files inside `resources/sources/css` are combined to form one minified css
file (`index.min.css`) and a corresponding map file (`index.min.css.map`). The
same process is repeated for the javascript files.

```
.
├── app.js
├── public
│   ├── css
│   │   ├── index.min.css
│   │   ├── index.min.css.map
│   └── js
│       ├── index.min.js
│       ├── index.min.js.map
└── resources
    └── sources
        ├── css
        │   ├── common.css
        │   ├── fonts.css
        │   └── index.css
        └── js
            ├── chat.js
            └── index.js
```

This process is extremely aggressive at optimizing javascript and CSS for file
size, in order to speed up content delivery. Unused attributes and functions are
stripped, and the finalized output is written to `public/`.

**Under no circumstances is it necessary to edit the output files in
`public/`!** In fact, these files are added to the `.gitignore` and should not
be committed.

## Running the project
By default, npm should run this app in development mode. Therefore, certain
settings such as gzip content encoding and HTML minifying are turned off. In
order to compare benchmarks, Hookups💋 has to be run in production.

This is generally done by exporting an environment variable to node.

```
export NODE_ENV=production
```

Of course, before running as production, be sure to rebuild the project using
grunt to optimize the delivery of static files. This can be done by running:

```
grunt production
```

### Performance comparison
Without `NODE_ENV=production`, `index.hbs` loads 381 KB of content in 5 requests.
Features such as HTML minify and gzip content encoding is turned off. Javascript
and CSS stylesheets are minified.

When `NODE_ENV=production` is set, `index.hbs` loads only 129 KB in 5 requests!
